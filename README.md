# low-poly-sword
This is my second project in Blender, where I modeled a stylized low-poly sword using only basic modeling techniques. The focus was on clean geometry, simple forms, and game-ready design.  
🔧 Key Highlights:
-> Created using extrusion, loop cuts, bevels, and mirroring
-> Optimized for low-poly game environments
-> Handcrafted blade, hilt, and guard with stylized proportions
-> Simple lighting setup for a clean render
🎯 Purpose:
To strengthen my understanding of hard-surface modeling in Blender and improve my sense of scale, symmetry, and shape design in 3D assets.
